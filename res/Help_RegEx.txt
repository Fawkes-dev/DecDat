"A regular expression is a sequence of characters that specifies a search pattern in text. "

The asterisk '*' to search for files is certainly familiar:
    *.d, *.*

Regular expressions can also be used to reconstruct such a pattern:
	.*\.d, .*\..*

The dot '.' represents any letter, the asterisk '*' indicates that the preceding character may occur any number of times (even not once).
'.*' means that any character may occur any number of times in the term you are looking for.

Alternatively, the plus '+' can be used to exclude a non-occurrence:
	.+\.d, .+\..+

The slash '\' before a dot '.' indicates that it is recognised as a dot, not as an arbitrary character.
This basic knowledge should be enough to be able to search for symbols consciously. Otherwise, the Wikipedia article will help.
