; A line preceded by a semicolon is evaluated as a comment.
; The export definition is an emergency solution to be able to export a .dat completely to different files.

; The following setting would export all externals to "_intern\Externals.d", all other symbols to "Misc.d":

938		_intern\Externals.d
-		Misc.d

; The notation is <SymbolID> <File>, completely ignoring spaces and tabs before, after and between parameters.

; In this case, all writable symbols up to and including 938 are written to the file Externals.d.
; The '-' means "Up to the last symbol", so from 939 onwards all symbols are exported to Misc.d.

; For a symbol to be "writeable" it must meet the following requirements:
;	- The name must not contain a dot, so the symbol must be global.
;	- Das Symbol darf keine interne Konstante/Variable sein, also nicht mit 0xFF beginnen.

; This text is a valid export definition and can be used for testing.
